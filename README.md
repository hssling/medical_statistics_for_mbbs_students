---

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Web Browser**: Modern Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Local Server**: Python 3.8+ for development (`python -m http.server 8000`)
- **Optional**: R/Python/Stata for data analysis components

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hssling/medical_statistics_for_mbbs_students.git
cd medical_statistics_for_mbbs_students

# Start local development server
python -m http.server 8000

# Open in browser
# Visit: http://localhost:8000/
```

### **Create a downloadable ZIP archive**
GitHub rejects large binary files attached to pull requests, so the
`created_files.zip` archive is no longer tracked in version control. Generate a
fresh copy locally whenever you need to share the latest project artefacts:

```bash
python create_created_files_zip.py
```

The script lives in the repository root and excludes common build artefacts by
default, including Android packages (`.apk`, `.aab`). Run
`python create_created_files_zip.py --help` to learn how to customise the
output file name or tweak the exclusion list.

### **Production Deployment**
- **GitHub Pages**: Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions
- **CDN Integration**: Fast global content delivery
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for tablets and smartphones
