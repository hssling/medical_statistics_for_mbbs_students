## **VIDEO SCENE 1: Introduction (0:00 - 2:00)**

**[Visual: World map with TB statistics appearing, transitioning to microscope view of Mycobacterium tuberculosis]**

**Narrator (TTS Female Professional Voice):**

"Good day, I'm Dr. Priya Sharma, a public health specialist. Today we'll explore tuberculosis – one of humanity's oldest and deadliest diseases. Despite being preventable and curable, TB still claims over 1.3 million lives annually.

In this video, we'll cover:
- What causes tuberculosis
- How it spreads and who gets infected
- Signs and symptoms to watch for
- Diagnosis and treatment approaches
- Prevention strategies and global efforts

Let's start with the basics."

## **VIDEO SCENE 2: The TB Bacterium (2:00 - 3:30)**

**[Visual: Detailed animation showing TB bacteria structure, zooming from colony to individual bacillus]**

**Narrator:**

"The culprit behind tuberculosis is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a rod-shaped bacterium discovered by Robert Koch in 1882 – earning him the Nobel Prize.

What makes TB unique?
- It's an acid-fast bacterium, resisting common stains
- Grows slowly, taking 2-8 weeks to culture
- Can survive harsh conditions outside the body
- Forms a waxy coating that resists immune system attacks

TB primarily affects the lungs but can attack any organ – the spine, kidneys, or even the brain."

## **VIDEO SCENE 3: How TB Spreads (3:30 - 5:00)**

**[Visual: Interactive animation showing droplet transmission]**

**Narrator:**

"Tuberculosis spreads through the air when someone with active TB in their lungs coughs, sneezes, or even speaks. These tiny droplets containing TB bacteria can hang in the air for hours.

Key points about transmission:
- Close contact (sharing air) is most risky
- Crowded indoor spaces increase risk
- No transmission through touch, sharing food, or casual contact
- 1 active TB patient can infect 10-15 susceptible people annually

However, not everyone exposed gets sick. Your immune system wall off bacteria in 'latent TB.' Only 5-10% progress to active disease."

**[Text: Risk Factors - Close contact, Crowded living, Poor ventilation, Weakened immunity]**

## **VIDEO SCENE 4: Who is Most Vulnerable (5:00 - 6:30)**

**[Visual: Demographic charts showing vulnerable populations]**

**Narrator:**

"Certain groups face higher TB risk due to weakened defenses:

- People with HIV (20-fold increased risk)
- Diabetics (3 times more likely)
- Smokers and tobacco users
- Alcohol and drug abusers
- Children under 5, with expanding rates at puberty
- Elderly and malnourished individuals
- Those with chronic lung conditions like silicosis

In India, urban slums, migrants, and prisoners show highest rates due to crowded living conditions and lack of healthcare access."

## **VIDEO SCENE 5: Signs and Symptoms (6:30 - 8:00)**

**[Visual: Body illustrations showing symptoms]**

**Narrator:**

"Pulmonary TB symptoms develop gradually over weeks to months:

Primary symptoms:
- Persistent cough lasting 3+ weeks
- Blood-streaked sputum (hemoptysis)
- Chest pain during breathing or coughing

Systemic symptoms:
- Weight loss and loss of appetite
- Fever, especially evening sweats
- Fatigue and weakness
- Night sweats drenching sleeping clothes

Advanced disease may show:
- Difficulty breathing (dyspnea)
- Swelling in neck (scrofula) from lymph nodes

Extra-pulmonary TB (affecting organs) show different symptoms – joint pain with bone TB, confusion with meningeal TB."

## **VIDEO SCENE 6: Diagnosis Process (8:00 - 9:30)**

**[Visual: Medical testing sequence]**

**Narrator:**

"TB diagnosis combines history, examination, and tests:

1. **Symptom screening** - Cough, fever, weight loss triad
2. **Chest X-ray** - Looks for characteristic shadows, but not definitive
3. **Sputum microscopy** - Direct visualization of bacteria in stained sputum
4. **Molecular tests** - GeneXpert detects TB and rifampicin resistance in 2 hours
5. **Culture** - Gold standard but takes 6-8 weeks

Early diagnosis saves lives and prevents further transmission. In India, sputum microscopy remains the backbone of rural TB diagnosis."

## **VIDEO SCENE 7: Treatment and DOTS Strategy (9:30 - 12:00)**

**[Visual: Medication regimen animations]**

**Narrator:**

"TB is curable with proper treatment. WHO's DOTS strategy revolutionized TB control:

**Key components:**
- Accurate diagnosis using microscopy
- Standardized treatment regimens
- Directly observed treatment (witnessed pill-taking)
- Uninterrupted drug supply
- Systematic monitoring and reporting

**Drug regimen for new cases:**
- Intensive phase (2 months): 4 drugs daily (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol)
- Continuation phase (4 months): 2 drugs three times/week

**Special cases:**
- MDR-TB requires specialized regimens lasting 18-24 months
- Side effects (hearing loss, skin rash) managed with supportive care
- Nutritional support crucial during treatment"

## **VIDEO SCENE 8: Drug Resistance and MDR-TB (12:00 - 13:00)**

**[Visual: Resistance mechanism animation]**

**Narrator:**

"Drug-resistant TB emerges when treatment isn't completed properly. MDR-TB resists the two main drugs. In India, we see both primary and acquired resistance patterns.

Treatment for MDR-TB:
- Uses second-line drugs lasting 18-24 months
- Newer regimens like Bedaquiline reduce duration to 9 months
- Outpatient-based care with intensive monitoring

Prevention: Always complete full treatment course, don't share medications."

## **VIDEO SCENE 9: Prevention Strategies (13:00 - 14:30)**

**[Visual: Prevention campaign animations]**

**Narrator:**

"Tuberculosis is preventable:

**Primary prevention:**
- BCG vaccine for children (90% protection against severe forms)
- Environmental controls in crowded settings
- Healthy lifestyles: good nutrition, no smoking

**Secondary prevention:**
- Early detection through symptom screening
- Contact tracing around confirmed cases
- Prophylaxis (preventive treatment) for high-risk contacts

**Tertiary prevention:**
- Curative treatment (covered above)
- Rehabilitation services

In India, Mission Satat focuses on preventing TB among vulnerable groups."

## **VIDEO SCENE 10: Global Fight Against TB (14:30 - 15:00)**

**[Visual: Success stories and future goals]**

**Narrator:**

"The global community is fighting back. India's RNTCP program cured over 21 million patients since 2000.

WHO's End TB Strategy aims for:
- 95% reduction in TB deaths by 2035
- 90% reduction in TB incidence
- Zero families suffering catastrophic costs

Each of us can contribute - by recognizing symptoms, completing treatment, and supporting affected families.

Remember: TB is curable, preventable, and everyone's responsibility."
