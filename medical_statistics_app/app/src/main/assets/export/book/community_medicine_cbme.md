## 1.1 Introduction to Epidemiology

### 1.1.1 Definition and Scope
Epidemiology is the scientific study of disease occurrence and distribution in populations. In community medicine, epidemiology serves as the foundation evidence-based public health practice.

**Key Concept:** Epidemiology = Distribution + Determinants + Health Outcomes

### 1.1.2 Historical Development
- John Snow (London Cholera - 1854): First epidemiological study using case mapping
- Framingham Heart Study (1948): Pioneered longitudinal cohort studies
- Modern epidemiology integrated with BIG data and AI for real-time outbreak detection

---

## 1.2 Basic Epidemiological Principles

### 1.2.1 Agent, Host, and Environment Model
**Pathogen**: Infectious agent (bacteria, virus, parasite)
**Host**: Susceptible individual with protective/immunosuppressive factors
**Environment**: External factors (nutrition, sanitation, socio-economic status)

**CBME Skill Development:** Analyze host-environment interactions in disease causation

### 1.2.2 Modes of Disease Transmission
1. **Direct Transmission**: Person-to-person contact
   - Examples: Handshake (STDs), droplet (COVID-19), blood-borne (HIV)
2. **Indirect Transmission**
   - Airborne: Mycobacterium tuberculosis
   - Vehicleborne (food): Salmonella, Vibrio cholerae
   - Vector-borne: Malaria (Plasmodium), Dengue (Aedes)

---

## 1.3 Epidemiological Methods

- **Cross-sectional Surveys**: Prevalence estimation
- **Ecological (Place-Time) Studies**: Population-level correlations

**CBME Competency A1**: Demonstrate ability to conduct community health surveys

#### Analytical Studies
**Focus**: Why (etiologic relationships)

**Cohort Studies**
- Advantages: Temporality established, multiple outcomes measured
- Disadvantages: Costly, time-consuming, rare outcomes
- Example: Józwiak et al. (2023) HPV vaccination cohort study

**Case-Control Studies**

---

## 1.4 Measures of Disease Frequency

### 1.4.1 Prevalence and Incidence

**Prevalence (P)** = Number of existing cases / Total population

Types:
- **Point Prevalence**: Cases at specific time point
- **Period Prevalence**: Cases over specific time period
- **Lifetime Prevalence**: Cases over entire lifetime

**Incidence (I)** = Number of new cases / Population at risk

Types:
- **Cumulative Incidence**: Total new cases / Population initially at risk
- **Incidence Density/Rate**: New cases per unit person-time

**Relationship:/** P ≈ I × D
(Where D = average disease duration)

---

## 1.5 Epidemiological Calculations

### 1.5.1 Odds Ratio and Relative Risk

**Relative Risk (RR)** = Incidence in exposed / Incidence in unexposed

Interpretation:
- RR > 1: Positive association (exposure increases risk)
- RR < 1: Negative association (exposure decreases risk)
- RR = 1: No association

**Odds Ratio (OR)** = (a/c) / (b/d) = ad/bc

OR ≈ RR for rare diseases (<10% prevalence)

---

|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Scope | Individual knowledge/behavior change | Systemic, social, environmental changes |
| Focus | Information + skills development | Policy + environmental support |
| Target | Individual/community beliefs | Social determinants of health |
| Approach | Cognitive change | Ecological approach |

---

## 3.2 Theories and Models of Health Behavior

### 3.2.1 Health Belief Model (HBM) - Rosenstock (1966, 1974)

**Key Constructs:**
- **Perceived Susceptibility:** Belief about likelihood of getting a disease
- **Perceived Severity:** Belief about seriousness of the disease and consequences
- **Perceived Benefits:** Belief about effectiveness of recommended action
- **Perceived Barriers:** Belief about personal costs and obstacles to action
- **Cues to Action:** Triggers for health behavior
- **Self-Efficacy:** Confidence in performing the recommended action

**Equation:** Health Behavior = (Perceived Susceptibility × Perceived Severity × Perceived Benefits) - Perceived Barriers

**Applications in Community Health:**
- **Immunization Campaigns:** Increase perceived susceptibility to vaccine-preventable diseases
- **Cancer Screening:** Enhance benefits while minimizing perceived barriers
- **Tobacco Cessation:** Address perceived benefits of quitting vs. barriers

### 3.2.2 Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) - Ajzen (1985, 1991)

**Key Constructs:**
- **Attitude toward Behavior:** Positive/negative evaluation of performing behavior
- **Subjective Norms:** Perceived social pressure to perform/not perform behavior
- **Perceived Behavioral Control:** Perceived ease/difficulty of performing behavior
- **Intention:** Motivation to perform behavior

**Relationship:** Intention → Behavior → (Attitude + Norms + Perceived Control) × Events

### 3.2.3 Stages of Change Model (Transtheoretical Model) - Prochaska & DiClemente (1983)

**Stages:**
1. **Precontemplation:** Not intending to change (no awareness)
2. **Contemplation:** Considering change (aware of pros/cons)
3. **Preparation:** Preparing to change (small initial steps)
4. **Action:** Actively modifying behavior (sustained change)
5. **Maintenance:** Sustaining change for 6+ months
6. **Termination:** Zero temptation, 100% self-efficacy
7. **Relapse:** Return to earlier stage (normal part of process)

**Interventions by Stage:**
| Stage | Intervention Type | Example |
|-------|------------------|---------|
| Precontemplation | Awareness Raising, Consciousness Raising | Public campaigns |
| Contemplation | Self/Evaluation, Environmental Revaluation | Counseling sessions |
| Preparation | Commitment Strengthening, Stimulus Control | Action planning |
| Action | Reinforcement Management, Helping Relationships | Support groups |
| Maintenance | Counter-Conditioning, Stimulus Control | Follow-up programs |

### 3.2.4 Social Ecological Model (SEM) - McLeroy et al. (1988)

**Five Levels:**
1. **Intrapersonal (Individual):** Knowledge, attitudes, behavior, self-concept
2. **Interpersonal (Social):** Family, friends, social networks
3. **Organizational/Institutional:** Rules, norms, policies of organizations
4. **Community:** Relationships among organizations, community norms
5. **Policy/Societal:** Laws, regulations, economic incentives

**CBME Competency Integration:** Community health education requires addressing all levels simultaneously.
