## 3.1 Health Education in Community Medicine

### 3.1.1 Definition and Scope
Health education is a process that empowers individuals and communities to gain greater control over their health needs and improve their quality of life through acquisition of knowledge and skills to adopt healthy behaviors.

**Ottawa Charter (1986) Definition:**
"It is any combination of learning experiences designed to help individuals and communities improve their health, by increasing their knowledge or influencing their attitudes."

### 3.1.2 Importance in Community Health
- **Empowerment:** Enables individuals to take control of their health
- **Prevention:** Primary prevention through lifestyle modification
- **Equity:** Addresses health disparities in underserved populations
- **Cost-effective:** Prevents expensive interventional treatments

### 3.1.3 Health Education vs Health Promotion
| Aspect | Health Education | Health Promotion |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Scope | Individual knowledge/behavior change | Systemic, social, environmental changes |
| Focus | Information + skills development | Policy + environmental support |
| Target | Individual/community beliefs | Social determinants of health |
| Approach | Cognitive change | Ecological approach |

## 3.2 Theories and Models of Health Behavior

### 3.2.1 Health Belief Model (HBM) - Rosenstock (1966, 1974)

**Key Constructs:**
- **Perceived Susceptibility:** Belief about likelihood of getting a disease
- **Perceived Severity:** Belief about seriousness of the disease and consequences
- **Perceived Benefits:** Belief about effectiveness of recommended action
- **Perceived Barriers:** Belief about personal costs and obstacles to action
- **Cues to Action:** Triggers for health behavior
- **Self-Efficacy:** Confidence in performing the recommended action

**Equation:** Health Behavior = (Perceived Susceptibility × Perceived Severity × Perceived Benefits) - Perceived Barriers

**Applications in Community Health:**
- **Immunization Campaigns:** Increase perceived susceptibility to vaccine-preventable diseases
- **Cancer Screening:** Enhance benefits while minimizing perceived barriers
- **Tobacco Cessation:** Address perceived benefits of quitting vs. barriers

### 3.2.2 Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) - Ajzen (1985, 1991)

**Key Constructs:**
- **Attitude toward Behavior:** Positive/negative evaluation of performing behavior
- **Subjective Norms:** Perceived social pressure to perform/not perform behavior
- **Perceived Behavioral Control:** Perceived ease/difficulty of performing behavior
- **Intention:** Motivation to perform behavior

**Relationship:** Intention → Behavior → (Attitude + Norms + Perceived Control) × Events

### 3.2.3 Stages of Change Model (Transtheoretical Model) - Prochaska & DiClemente (1983)

**Stages:**
1. **Precontemplation:** Not intending to change (no awareness)
2. **Contemplation:** Considering change (aware of pros/cons)
3. **Preparation:** Preparing to change (small initial steps)
4. **Action:** Actively modifying behavior (sustained change)
5. **Maintenance:** Sustaining change for 6+ months
6. **Termination:** Zero temptation, 100% self-efficacy
7. **Relapse:** Return to earlier stage (normal part of process)

**Interventions by Stage:**
| Stage | Intervention Type | Example |
|-------|------------------|---------|
| Precontemplation | Awareness Raising, Consciousness Raising | Public campaigns |
| Contemplation | Self/Evaluation, Environmental Revaluation | Counseling sessions |
| Preparation | Commitment Strengthening, Stimulus Control | Action planning |
| Action | Reinforcement Management, Helping Relationships | Support groups |
| Maintenance | Counter-Conditioning, Stimulus Control | Follow-up programs |

### 3.2.4 Social Ecological Model (SEM) - McLeroy et al. (1988)

**Five Levels:**
1. **Intrapersonal (Individual):** Knowledge, attitudes, behavior, self-concept
2. **Interpersonal (Social):** Family, friends, social networks
3. **Organizational/Institutional:** Rules, norms, policies of organizations
4. **Community:** Relationships among organizations, community norms
5. **Policy/Societal:** Laws, regulations, economic incentives

**CBME Competency Integration:** Community health education requires addressing all levels simultaneously.
