## 31.1 Introduction to Phenomenology

### 31.1.1 Philosophical Foundations
Phenomenology is a philosophical approach founded by Edmund Husserl in the early 20th century, focusing on the study of conscious experience and the ways in which things appear to us.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Intentionality**: Consciousness is always consciousness of something
- **Lifeworld**: The pre-reflective world of everyday experience
- **Bracketing**: Setting aside preconceptions (epoche)
- **Essence**: The invariant structure of experience

### 31.1.2 Phenomenological Methods in Research
**Descriptive Phenomenology:**
- **Husserlian Approach**: Pure description of experience
- **Focus**: Essential structures of consciousness
- **Method**: Systematic reflection and description

**Interpretive Phenomenology:**
- **Heideggerian Approach**: Interpretation of meaning
- **Focus**: Existential dimensions of experience
- **Method**: Hermeneutic circle of understanding

## 31.3 Phenomenological Research Design

### 31.3.1 Research Questions
Phenomenological research questions focus on understanding the essence of lived experience.

**Characteristics:**

- **Interpretive**: What does it mean?
- **Existential**: What is the human significance?

**Examples:**

- "What does recovery mean to mental health patients?"

### 31.3.2 Sampling Strategy
**Purposeful Sampling:**
- **Criterion Sampling**: Participants who have experienced the phenomenon
- **Maximum Variation**: Diverse experiences for rich description
- **Snowball Sampling**: Participants recommend others

**Sample Size:**
- **Small Samples**: 5-15 participants typically
