## 35.1 Introduction to Systems Thinking

### 35.1.1 Systems Thinking Defined
Systems thinking is a holistic approach to understanding complex systems, focusing on relationships, patterns, and interdependencies rather than isolated components.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Holism**: The whole is greater than the sum of parts
- **Interconnectedness**: Everything affects everything else
- **Feedback Loops**: Self-reinforcing or balancing mechanisms
- **Emergence**: System-level properties from component interactions

### 35.1.2 Systems Thinking vs Reductionism
**Reductionist Approach:**
- **Analysis**: Breaking down into smaller parts
- **Focus**: Individual components and linear causality
- **Limitations**: Misses system-level interactions
- **Example**: Treating symptoms without addressing root causes

**Systems Approach:**
- **Synthesis**: Understanding whole system dynamics
- **Focus**: Relationships, patterns, and feedback
- **Strengths**: Captures complexity and unintended consequences
- **Example**: Addressing social determinants of health

## 35.2 Systems Thinking Frameworks

### 35.2.1 Iceberg Model
**Visible Aspects:**
- **Events**: Observable occurrences (disease outbreaks)
- **Patterns**: Trends over time (rising obesity rates)
- **Structures**: Underlying systems (food industry, urban planning)

**Hidden Aspects:**
- **Mental Models**: Beliefs and assumptions (personal responsibility only)
- **Purpose**: System goals and values (profit vs health)

**Application:** Understanding why interventions fail by addressing root causes

### 35.2.2 Causal Loop Diagrams
**Reinforcing Loops (R):**
- **Growth**: Self-reinforcing positive feedback
- **Example**: Poverty → Poor education → Limited jobs → Poverty
- **Symbol**: Clockwise arrow with R

**Balancing Loops (B):**
- **Stability**: Self-correcting negative feedback
- **Example**: Population growth → Resource scarcity → Birth rate decline
- **Symbol**: Counter-clockwise arrow with B

**Applications:**
- **Policy Analysis**: Understanding intervention impacts
- **Problem Solving**: Identifying leverage points
- **Scenario Planning**: Anticipating system responses
