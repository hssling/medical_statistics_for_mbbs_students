- **Global Incidence**: 10.6 million new TB cases annually
- **Global Mortality**: 1.3 million deaths from TB (excluding HIV-TB)
- **Regional Distribution**: Southeast Asia (45%), Africa (25%), Western Pacific (18%)
- **Drug-Resistant TB**: 450,000 MDR-TB cases notified

**India's TB Burden (2022):**
- **Annual Incidence**: 2.94 million new cases (highest global burden)
- **Pulmonary TB** (PTB): 2.02 million cases (68.6%)
- **Extrapulmonary TB** (EPTB): 0.92 million cases (31.4%)
- **Deaths**: 271,000 TB deaths annually
- **Annual Risk of Infection (ARI)**: 31 per 1,000 population
- **Smear-Positive TB Prevalence**: 323 per 100,000 population

**Key Epidemiological Trends:**
- **Historical Decline**: India reported 17.5 lakh TB cases in 2012 (current: 29 lakh) - actually increase due to improved case finding
- **Death Rate Reduction**: From 35/100,000 in 2015 to 23.6/100,000 in 2021
- **Detection Gap**: 1.2 million cases still remain unreported annually

### 7.1.2 Risk Factors and Vulnerable Groups

**Socioeconomic Determinants:**
- **Middle Class (30-49 age)**: 45.7% of TB cases - economic burden
- **Urban Slums**: Increased transmission due to crowding
- **Tribal Areas**: Poor access to healthcare, malnutrition
- **Migrants**: Seasonal labor population, stressed by urban-rural movement
- **Prison Inmates**: Higher TB risk due to overcrowding

**Medical Co-morbids:**
- **Diabetes Mellitus**: 3-fold increased TB risk, poor treatment outcomes
- **HIV Co-infection**: 3.6 lakh TB-HIV cases annually
- **Chronic Lung Diseases**: Silicosis, COPD, tobacco-related
- **Substance Abuse**: Alcohol, drug abuse increases susceptibility
- **Immunocompromised States**: Cancer, organ transplant

**Biological Factors:**
- **Drug Resistance**: 2.2% primary MDR-TB, 10-15% acquired resistance
