## 2.1 Principles of Preventive Medicine

### 2.1.1 Levels of Disease Prevention

**Primary Prevention**
- **Definition**: Prevents disease occurrence
- **Strategy**: Health promotion, risk factor elimination
- **Examples**: Immunization, tobacco control, seat belt legislation

**Secondary Prevention**
- **Definition**: Early detection and treatment of asymptomatic disease
- **Strategy**: Screening programs, case-finding
- **Examples**: Cancer screening (mammography, colonoscopy), blood pressure monitoring

**Tertiary Prevention**
- **Definition**: Preventing complications and disability from established disease
- **Strategy**: Rehabilitation and functional restoration
- **Examples**: Cardiac rehabilitation, diabetes foot care, physiotherapy

### 2.1.2 Preventive Medicine in Community Health
- **At-Risk Approach**: Target high-risk individuals
- **Population Approach**: Mass interventions for entire communities
- **Screening Criteria**: Wilson & Junger (1968)
  - Condition should be important health problem
  - Natural history understood
  - Suitable screening test available
  - Effective treatment exists
  - Cost-effective implementation

### 2.1.3 Health Promotion Models
**Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion (1986):**
1. Build healthy public policy
2. Create supportive environments
3. Strengthen community action
4. Develop personal skills
5. Reorient health services

**Health Belief Model:** Perceived susceptibility × perceived severity × perceived benefits - perceived barriers

## 2.2 Immunization Programs

### 2.2.1 Vaccine Development Types

**Live Attenuated Vaccines**
- Advantages: Long-lasting immunity, stimulate both humoral and cell-mediated immunity
- Disadvantages: Stability issues, contraindicated in immunocompromised persons
- Examples: Oral polio vaccine, BCG vaccine

**Inactivated/Killed Vaccines**
- Advantages: Safe in immunocompromised individuals, stable
- Disadvantages: May need booster doses, no mucosal immunity
- Examples: Hepatitis A vaccine, influenza vaccine

**Subunit Vaccines**
- Advantages: Safe, no risk of infection, minimal side effects
- Disadvantages: May need adjuvants, potentially less effective
- Examples: Hepatitis B vaccine, HPV vaccine

**Recombinant Vaccines**
- Advantages: Pure antigens, no infectious agents
- Disadvantages: Complex manufacturing
- Examples: Hepatitis B recombinant vaccine

### 2.2.2 Immunization Schedules (India)

**UNICEF EPI Schedule:**

| Age | Vaccines |
|-----|----------|
| Birth | BCG, OPV-0, Hep B-1 |
| 6 weeks | DPT-1, OPV-1, Hep B-2, Hib-1, Rotavirus-1, Pneumococcal-1 |
| 10 weeks | DPT-2, OPV-2, Hib-2, Rotavirus-2, Pneumococcal-2 |
| 14 weeks | DPT-3, OPV-3, Hep B-3, Hib-3, Rotavirus-3, Pneumococcal-3 |
| 6 months | Oral Typhoid, Vitamin A |
| 9 months | MMR-1, Hep A-1 |

### 2.2.3 Vaccine Administration Techniques

**Route-Specific Administration:**

| Route | Technique | Examples |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Intramuscular | 90° angle, vastus lateralis (VL) | DPT, TT |
| Subcutaneous | 45° angle, upper arm | MMR, Hep B |
| Intradermal | 10-15° angle, forearm | BCG |
| Oral | Direct administration | OPV |
| Nasal spray | Intranasal | Flu vaccine |

**Cold Chain Management:**
- **Vaccine Vial Monitors (VVM)**: Heat exposure indicators
- **Tier System**: National → State → District → Block → Village
- **Maintenance**: +2°C to +8°C for most vaccines, -20°C for some (beyond use date impossible to predict)

## Summary

Preventive medicine shifts healthcare paradigm from "sick care" to "well care". By implementing evidence-based preventive strategies and sustaining high immunization coverage, community health practitioners can:
- Reduce disease burden by 50-70% for vaccine-preventable diseases
- Contain outbreaks before they become epidemics
- Promote healthy lifestyles and wellness culture
- Achieve WHO's goal of universal health coverage

**Key Success Factors:** Community participation, sustained political commitment, health literacy, and intersectoral coordination.

**Next Chapter:** Community Health Education Methods - building on these foundations.
