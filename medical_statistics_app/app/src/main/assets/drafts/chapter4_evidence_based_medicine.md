## 4.1 Foundations of Evidence-Based Medicine

### 4.1.1 Definition and Evolution of EBM

**Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM)** is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. In community health, EBM extends to organizational and population-level decisions.

**Sackett's Definition (1996):**
"The integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values."

**Evolution Timeline:**
- **1970s**: Clinical decision analysis and meta-analysis development
- **1990s**: EBM movement (Guyatt, Sackett, O'Connell)
- **2000s**: Evidence-based practice in nursing, public health, health policy
- **2010s**: Real-time evidence in digital health, rapid reviews
- **2020s**: AI-assisted EBM, living systematic reviews, precision EBM

### 4.1.2 EBM Pyramid Hierarchy of Evidence

Evidence is classified by methodological rigor and risk of bias:

**Level I (Strongest Evidence):**
- Meta-analyses of RCTs
- Systematic reviews of RCTs
- RCTs with low risk of bias

**Level II (Moderate Evidence):**
- Meta-analyses of cohort studies
- RCTs with moderate risk of bias
- Cohort studies

**Level III (Weak Evidence):**
- Meta-analyses of case-control studies
- Case-control studies
- Systematic reviews of randomized trials with higher risk of bias

**Level IV (Very Weak Evidence):**
- Non-experimental studies
- Narrative reviews
- Expert opinion
- Anecdotal evidence

**Level V (Weakest/Unsupported):** Unsystematic clinical observations

### 4.1.3 Steps of Evidence-Based Practice

**EBM 6-Step Process:**

1. **Ask**: Formulate focused clinical/community health question
   - **PICO Framework**: Population-Intervention-Control-Outcome
   - **Example**: Population (Rural school children), Intervention (Micronutrient supplementation), Control (No intervention), Outcome (Cognitive development scores)

2. **Acquire**: Search literature systematically
   - **Databases**: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Campbell Collaboration
   - **Keywords**: Use MeSH terms, Boolean operators, proximity operators

3. **Appraise**: Critically evaluate evidence quality
   - **Internal Validity**: Free from systematic bias?
   - **External Validity**: Applicable to target population?
   - **Clinical Relevance**: Magnitude of effect size?

4. **Apply**: Integrate evidence with clinical expertise
   - **Local Context**: Cultural, economic, infrastructure considerations
   - **Stakeholder Values**: Community preferences and resources

5. **Assess**: Evaluate outcomes and adapt practice
   - **Program Monitoring**: Process indicators and outcome metrics
   - **Continuous Improvement**: Quality improvement cycles

### 4.1.4 Critical Appraisal Tools

**CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) Checklists:**

For randomized controlled trials:
- Were participants randomized?
- Was treatment allocation concealed?
- Were participants blinded?
- Was outcome data complete?
- Are there any threats to validity?

**Joanna Briggs Institute Checklists:**
- For qualitative research
- For diagnostic test accuracy
- For observational studies

**GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation):**
- Assesses quality of evidence on four levels (high, moderate, low, very low)
- Considers limitations, consistency, directness, precision, publication bias

### 4.2.2 Meta-Analysis Methodology

**Effect Size Measures:**
- **Risk Difference (RD)**: Absolute risk reduction ARR = CER - EER

- **Odds Ratio (OR)**: OR = (a/b) ÷ (c/d)
- **Number Needed to Treat (NNT)**: NNT = 1/ARR
- **Standardized Mean Difference (SMD)**: Cohen's d for continuous outcomes

**Statistical Methods:**
- **Fixed Effects Model**: Assumes single true effect size
- **Random Effects Model**: Accounts for heterogeneity between studies
- **Meta-Regression**: Explore moderators and predictors

**Forest Plot Interpretation:**
- Each horizontal line: individual study
- Diamond: pooled effect estimate
- Width of horizontal lines: 95% CI
- Diamond width: overall CI

## 4.10 Summary

Evidence-based medicine transforms medical practice from opinion-based to science-informed decision making. In community health, EBM provides rigorous frameworks for program design, implementation, and evaluation.

**Key EBM Principles:**
- **Hierarchy of Evidence:** Prefer RCTs for interventions, cohort studies for harms
- **Systematic Reviews:** Gold standard for evidence synthesis
- **Critical Appraisal:** Essential skill for evidence utilization
- **Contextual Adaptation:** Evidence application to local conditions and resources

**CBME Integration:** EBM develops competencies in research methods, data interpretation, and policy formulation - foundational skills for evidence-based public health practice.

**Next Chapter Integration:** EBM principles extend to communicable disease control programs (Chapter 8), where systematic reviews guide outbreak response strategies and program evaluations determine effectiveness.
