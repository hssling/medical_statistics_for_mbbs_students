## 6.10 Summary

NAC-IV represents India's unified response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, integrating prevention, treatment, and stigma reduction strategies. The programme's success in achieving global targets while addressing India's unique epidemiological context demonstrates the effectiveness of public-private partnerships in health system strengthening.

**Key Milestones Achieved (2000-2022):**
- New infections reduced from 2.7 lakh to ~60,000 annually
- ART coverage expanded from 2,000 to 15 lakh patients
- Survival rate improved from 8 months to over 20 years
- Integration with other health programmes (RNTCP, PPP)

**Continuing Priorities:**
- Sustainable funding mechanisms beyond donor dependence
- Innovation in testing and linkage strategies
- Universal Health Coverage integration
- Elimination of vertical transmission
- Private sector HIV test mandates

**Programme Philosophy:** HIV/AIDS control requires compassionate care combined with aggressive prevention strategies, with community ownership and human rights protection as foundational principles.

**Next Chapter Integration:** Chapter 9 builds on HIV surveillance systems to establish comprehensive disease reporting mechanisms across communicable diseases, integrating ICTC networks with IDSP for unified outbreak response strategies.
