**Future Directions:**
- Elimination programs (Malaria 2030, JE localized)
- Vaccine integration (JE, dengue, JE-CHIK combo)
- Digital surveillance scaling
- Climate change adaptation strategies

**Next Chapter Link:** Chapter 7 builds on surveillance systems to establish disease notification and reporting mechanisms essential for outbreak detection and response.
