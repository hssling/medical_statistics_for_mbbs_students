## 14.1 Principles of Child Growth and Development

### 14.1.1 Growth Patterns in Children
Growth velocity varies by age, with rapid growth in infancy and adolescence.

**Infancy (0-1 year):**
- Weight gain: 25-30g/day
- Length gain: 2.5 cm/month
- Head circumference: 1.5 cm/month

**Early childhood (1-5 years):**
- Weight gain: 2-2.5 kg/year
- Height gain: 6-8 cm/year
- Slower growth velocity

### 14.1.2 Developmental Milestones
**Gross Motor:**
- 2 months: Head control
- 6 months: Sitting without support
- 12 months: Walking independently

**Fine Motor:**
- 3 months: Grasps objects
- 9 months: Pincer grasp
- 15 months: Builds tower of 2 cubes

**Language:**
- 6 months: Babbles
- 12 months: First words
- 24 months: Two-word phrases

**Length/Height:**
- **Infants**: Length board (supine)
- **Children**: Stadiometer (standing)
- **Accuracy**: ±0.1 cm

**Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC):**

- **Use**: Community screening for malnutrition

### 14.2.2 Growth Charts
**WHO Growth Standards (2006):**
- **Weight-for-age**: Overall growth
- **Length/height-for-age**: Linear growth
- **Weight-for-length/height**: Body proportionality
- **Head circumference**: Brain growth

**Interpretation:**
- **Z-score**: Deviation from median
- **Percentile**: Position relative to reference
- **Centile bands**: Normal (-2 to +2 SD)

**Acute Malnutrition (Wasting):**
- **Moderate**: -2 to -3 SD weight-for-height
- **Severe**: <-3 SD weight-for-height or MUAC <11.5 cm

**Chronic Malnutrition (Stunting):**
- **Moderate**: -2 to -3 SD height-for-age
- **Severe**: <-3 SD height-for-age

**Underweight:**
- **Moderate**: -2 to -3 SD weight-for-age
- **Severe**: <-3 SD weight-for-age

### 14.4.2 Management Protocols
**Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM):**
- **Assessment**: MUAC, edema, appetite
- **Treatment**: Ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF)
- **Monitoring**: Weekly weight gain
- **Referral**: For medical complications

**Growth Promotion:**
- **Counseling**: Responsive feeding, dietary diversity
- **Supplementation**: Micronutrient powders
- **Stimulation**: Play and development activities
