- Decision support for interventions
- Performance evaluation of health programs

### 9.1.2 Evolution of HIS
- **Paper-based systems**: Manual reporting and record-keeping
- **Electronic Health Records (EHR)**: Digitized patient data
- **Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP)**: Real-time web-based reporting
- **Digital Health Ecosystem**: AI-powered predictive analytics

4. **Administrative data**: Vital statistics, program reports

### 9.2.2 Data Flow Architecture
**Input → Processing → Storage → Analysis → Output**

- **Input**: Data entry from multiple sources
- **Processing**: Data validation and cleaning
- **Storage**: Secure databases with backup systems
- **Analysis**: Statistical tools and dashboards
- **Output**: Reports, alerts, policy recommendations

### 9.2.3 Technology Infrastructure
- **Hardware**: Servers, computers, mobile devices
- **Software**: Database management systems (DHIS2, HMIS)
- **Networks**: Internet connectivity, VPNs for security
- **Cloud Computing**: Scalable storage and processing

## 9.3 Disease Surveillance Systems

### 9.3.1 Types of Surveillance

#### Passive Surveillance
- Routine reporting by health facilities
- Advantages: Cost-effective, continuous monitoring
- Disadvantages: Under-reporting, delayed detection

#### Active Surveillance
- Targeted data collection for specific diseases
- Advantages: Complete data, early detection
- Disadvantages: Resource-intensive, limited scope

#### Sentinel Surveillance
- Selected sites for intensive monitoring
- Example: Influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance

### 9.3.2 Surveillance Indicators
- **Morbidity indicators**: Disease incidence and prevalence
- **Mortality indicators**: Cause-specific death rates
- **Process indicators**: Vaccination coverage, case detection
- **Outcome indicators**: Program impact assessment
