## 1.1 Introduction to Epidemiology

### 1.1.1 Definition and Scope
Epidemiology is the scientific study of disease occurrence and distribution in populations. In community medicine, epidemiology serves as the foundation evidence-based public health practice.

**Key Concept:** Epidemiology = Distribution + Determinants + Health Outcomes

### 1.1.2 Historical Development
- John Snow (London Cholera - 1854): First epidemiological study using case mapping
- Framingham Heart Study (1948): Pioneered longitudinal cohort studies
- Modern epidemiology integrated with BIG data and AI for real-time outbreak detection

---

## 1.2 Basic Epidemiological Principles

### 1.2.1 Agent, Host, and Environment Model
**Pathogen**: Infectious agent (bacteria, virus, parasite)
**Host**: Susceptible individual with protective/immunosuppressive factors
**Environment**: External factors (nutrition, sanitation, socio-economic status)

**CBME Skill Development:** Analyze host-environment interactions in disease causation

### 1.2.2 Modes of Disease Transmission
1. **Direct Transmission**: Person-to-person contact
   - Examples: Handshake (STDs), droplet (COVID-19), blood-borne (HIV)
2. **Indirect Transmission**
   - Airborne: Mycobacterium tuberculosis
   - Vehicleborne (food): Salmonella, Vibrio cholerae
   - Vector-borne: Malaria (Plasmodium), Dengue (Aedes)

## 1.3 Epidemiological Methods

### 1.3.1 Observational Study Designs

#### Descriptive Studies
**Focus**: What, Who, Where, When
- **Case Reports/Case Series**: Individual patient descriptions
- **Cross-sectional Surveys**: Prevalence estimation
- **Ecological (Place-Time) Studies**: Population-level correlations

**CBME Competency A1**: Demonstrate ability to conduct community health surveys

#### Analytical Studies
**Focus**: Why (etiologic relationships)

**Cohort Studies**
- Advantages: Temporality established, multiple outcomes measured
- Disadvantages: Costly, time-consuming, rare outcomes
- Example: Józwiak et al. (2023) HPV vaccination cohort study

**Case-Control Studies**
- Advantages: Quick, inexpensive, suitable for rare diseases
- Disadvantages: Naive about exposure frequency, recall bias
- Example: Kocazeybek (2014) HBV case-control study

**Experimental Studies**
- Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)
- Field Trials
- Community Intervention Studies

## 1.4 Measures of Disease Frequency

### 1.4.1 Prevalence and Incidence

**Prevalence (P)** = Number of existing cases / Total population

Types:
- **Point Prevalence**: Cases at specific time point
- **Period Prevalence**: Cases over specific time period
- **Lifetime Prevalence**: Cases over entire lifetime

**Incidence (I)** = Number of new cases / Population at risk

Types:
- **Cumulative Incidence**: Total new cases / Population initially at risk
- **Incidence Density/Rate**: New cases per unit person-time

**Relationship:/** P ≈ I × D
(Where D = average disease duration)

---

## 1.5 Epidemiological Calculations

### 1.5.1 Odds Ratio and Relative Risk

**Relative Risk (RR)** = Incidence in exposed / Incidence in unexposed

Interpretation:
- RR > 1: Positive association (exposure increases risk)
- RR < 1: Negative association (exposure decreases risk)
- RR = 1: No association

**Odds Ratio (OR)** = (a/c) / (b/d) = ad/bc

OR ≈ RR for rare diseases (<10% prevalence)

---

## 1.6 Epidemiological Investigations

### 1.6.1 Outbreak Investigation Process
1. **Verify diagnosis** → Confirm - outbreak exists
2. **Establish case definition** → Standard criteria
3. **Search additional cases** → Active surveillance
4. **Determine distribution** → Person, place, time
5. **Formulate hypothesis** → Risk factor identification
6. **Test hypothesis** → Analytical epidemiology
7. **Implement control** → Intervention strategies
8. **Implement prevention** → Permanent solutions

### 1.6.2 Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP)
- CDC-developed competency-based program
- 2-year training for outbreak investigation
- Standard protocol for global health security

## 1.7 Case-Based Learning Scenario

**Case:** Outbreak of Acute Gastroenteritis in Urban Slum

**Patient Profile:** 25-year-old female presents with severe diarrhea, vomiting. Located in densely populated urban slum with inadequate sanitation.

**Symptoms:** Sudden onset, profuse watery stool, dehydration signs.

**Interview Findings:**
- Similar symptoms in 12 neighboring households
- Contaminated drinking water from public handpump

2. How would you conduct epidemiological investigation? (Skills)
3. Why is rapid community response critical? (Attitude)
4. How does this integrate with microbiology/food safety? (Integration)

## 1.10 Summary

Epidemiology provides the scientific foundation for community health practice. Understanding disease patterns, risk factors, and preventive strategies enables competent medical practitioners to:
- Identify health priorities in communities
- Design effective intervention programs
- Contribute to evidence-based public health policy
- Promote disease prevention and health promotion

**Key Takeaway:** Epidemiology transforms medical practice from individual patient care to population health management.
